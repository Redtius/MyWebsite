## If..else if..else

```Javascript
if (choice === "sunny" && temperature < 86) {
  para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — nice and sunny. Let's go out to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.`;
} else if (choice === "sunny" && temperature >= 86) {
  para.textContent = `It is ${temperature} degrees outside — REALLY HOT! If you want to go outside, make sure to put some sunscreen on.`;
}
else
{
 // something else
}
```

## Switch

```Javascript
const select = document.querySelector("select");
const para = document.querySelector("p");

select.addEventListener("change", setWeather);

function setWeather() {
  const choice = select.value;

  switch (choice) {
    case "sunny":
      para.textContent =
        "It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.";
      break;
    case "rainy":
      para.textContent =
        "Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don't stay out for too long.";
      break;
    case "snowing":
      para.textContent =
        "The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.";
      break;
    case "overcast":
      para.textContent =
        "It isn't raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.";
      break;
    default:
      para.textContent = "";
  }
}
```

## Ternary Operator

```Javascript
let age = 18;
let isAdult;

// Using ternary operator
isAdult = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";

console.log(isAdult); // Output: "Yes"
```
